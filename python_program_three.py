# I started with an empty list called Contacts. I then wrote out this example below of what a contact should look like:
# Example of a contact: Kevin {name : Kevin, phone : 714714, email: 714@scccd.edu} <--- this data values need to be input by users

Contacts = []

# "Your program should allow users to add, view, and search for contacts." <- This part of the Assignment Details tells me that the input() function needs to be used in order to add a new contact, phone number, and email:

name = Input("Please enter the name of your contact: ")
phone = Input("Please enter the name of your contact: ")
email = Input("Please enter the name of your contact: ")

# Now I have to add these values to the empty Contacts list.
